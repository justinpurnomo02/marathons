                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 500;">Background</h3>
                <p>Carlsbad was on my radar for a while now, as I used to live in the city right next to it (Oceanside) when I was in middle school. Additionally, a running influencer who I watched ran Carlsbad as her first marathon. I decided to sign up for it after passing my PhD qualifying exam, as some twisted form of celebration.</p>

                    <img src="images/carlsbad1.png" alt="Finish line" style="width: 100%; max-width: 300px; border-radius: 6px; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">

                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 500;">Pre-race</h3>
                <p>The night before the race, I grabbed Chipotle with one of my old friends from middle school who would be running the half. I was so inspired by the fact that he did a 50K just the week before. I don’t think I’ll be doing any official ultras anytime soon, but I might try a 50K in training. I later drove with my sister to grab a hefty baguette from Panera so I could carb load.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 500;">Mile 1</h3>
                <p>I quickly located the 3:10 pacer (who was a 62 year old man, insane), and positioned myself a couple feet away from him. I had some difficulty starting my Strava when we started so I was fiddling with my watch for the first 0.1 miles. But eventually it worked and I tucked myself in a pretty sizable group of people who also wanted to run 3:10.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 500;">Miles 2-12</h3>
                <p>I was cruising during this part. A part of me was wondering if I should have went with the 3 hour group, but I told myself numerous times during training that this thought was going to happen, and I had to resist the temptation. Early race miles are always free since you're running off of pure adrenaline. The fast miles will catch up to you eventually if you aren't careful.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 500;">Miles 13-20</h3>
                <p>The 3:10 pace group began to thin out at this point. Many people obviously went out too hot. I think there were around six of us still remaining. I was still cruising though.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 500;">Miles 21-24</h3>
                <p>The remainder of the 3:10 pace group completely fell apart here. Half of the group surged ahead, while the other half began to lag behind. I decided to bet on myself and surge ahead with this middle aged man wearing a purple sleeveless shirt. I later found out after the race he was able to get a Boston qualifying time of 3:08 (I think he needed a 3:10 for his age). 18-34 males like myself need a 2:55, but anyhow, I stuck right beside him for a little while, and he even complimented me. I also saw my middle school friend at this point, since the half started an hour and a half after the full and the courses overlap with each other.</p>

                <p>I soon began to feel slight pulses in my calves, so I decided to let purple shirt guy go off ahead. A spectator must have seen me struggling since she saw my bib and cheered for me by name. I wish I could have said something back, but I was so terrified my calf would just lock up I didn't want to waste any breath. I made eye contact with a volunteer who was handing out water and I stretched out my arm. He pointed at me and told me that he got me hahaha.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 500;">Miles 24-26.2</h3>
                <p>The 3:10 pacer caught back up to me at this point, so I decided that I was going to try to latch onto him for the rest of the race. Halfway into mile 25, I think Bin had some unexpected pain or something, since he began to slow down, and urged me to keep going. Honestly this kind of scared me since that meant I would be running in no man's land (i.e., no one to pace myself with). I ended up running with some half marathoners, but it wasn't quite the same you know?</p>

                <p>Once we approached mile 26 though, the 3:10 pacer passed me... and I knew that sub 3:10 wouldn't be possible. I had so much more to give, but I knew my calves would lock up if I pushed the pace by even just a hair. I ended up limping across the finish line, and got my 3:10:52.</p>

                <p>As a side note, I was wise to not push any harder... once I met my mom and sister at the finishers' area, my left calf and right thigh cramped so bad I almost cried. Medical staff checked in with me to make sure I was okay. Sometimes I don't know why I willingly sign up for these races haha.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 500;">Takeaways</h3>
                <p>Increasing mileage during this marathon block paid dividends. I had so much endurance, and as I said earlier, I felt like I had so much more to give. But even the strongest aerobic base can only get you so far if you lack the strength to maintain a fast speed. I think that's the biggest takeaway for my third marathon. I'm a pretty weak runner and I hope to change that in the next marathon block.</p>

                <p>One thing I want to highlight is how seamless Carlsbad was. The event was so well-organized, clean, and contained. My favorite marathon as of yet, and I would definitely come back again for a future race.</p>

                <p>I want to say I've gotten to a point where many non-runners would say I'm fast haha. Most people remember 7 minutes being their fastest mile time, so it's saying something if I can average 7:17 min per mile, 26.2 times. It certainly feels good to be a 3:10 marathoner, but I know that I have so much more to give to this race. Needless to say, I'll be gunning for sub 3 next time.</p>

                <p>A personal best on a stunning coastal course. The ocean breeze kept things cool despite the June timing, and the views were absolutely spectacular.</p>
                
                <p>My training block leading up to this was nearly perfect—no injuries, consistent mileage, and some solid tempo work. I felt ready and it showed.</p>
                
                <p>The last 5K was tough mentally, but I kept reminding myself why I was there and pushed through. Crossing that finish line with a new PR was worth every early morning and long run.</p>

                <p>My first trail marathon and definitely the most challenging race I've done. The elevation gain was no joke, and the altitude took some getting used to.</p>
                
                <p>I learned quickly that trail racing is a completely different beast. You can't focus on pace—it's all about effort and navigating the terrain safely.</p>
                
                <p>Despite the difficulty, the mountain scenery and the supportive trail running community made this an unforgettable experience. I'm already planning my next trail race.</p>
