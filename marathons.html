                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 500;">Background</h3>
                
                <p>Carlsbad has been on my radar for a while, as I used to live in Oceanside, a neighboring city, back in middle school. The area holds a lot of nostalgia for me, and I was excited to race on familiar roads.</p>
                
                <p>Additionally, Kris Hui - a running influencer I follow - ran Carlsbad as her first marathon, and her subsequent vlog sold me on the course. I decided to sign up for it after passing my PhD qualifying exam, as some twisted form of celebration. What better way to recover from one grueling experience than to sign up for another?</p>
                
                <p>Having ran a 3:31 in my previous marathon, I began my Carlsbad training block with a 3:20 time goal. However, my long runs went so well that I decided to go for 3:10 five weeks before race day.</p>
                
                <div style="clear: both;"></div>
                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 500;">Pre-race</h3>
                
                <img src="images/carlsbad1.png" alt="At the Carlsbad expo" style="float: right; width: 280px; margin: 0 0 1rem 1.5rem; border-radius: 6px;">
                <p style="float: right; clear: right; width: 280px; color: #666; font-size: 0.85rem; font-style: italic; text-align: center; margin: -0.5rem 0 1rem 1.5rem;">At the Carlsbad expo!</p>

                <p>I arrived at the Carlsbad Expo Saturday afternoon to pick up my race bib, and I got to meet two people who were a part of the pacing crew. When I told them that I was planning to be in the 3:10 pace group, they assured me that I was in good hands. Apparently, the 3:10 pacer (a 62 year old man named Bin) has ran Carlsbad for years and knew the course well.</p>

                <p>A couple hours later, I had the opportunity to grab Chipotle with an old friend who would be running in the half. What really impressed me was that he completed a 50K just the week before. I don’t think I’ll be participating in any official ultramarathons anytime soon, but I would definitely like to run a 50K sometime by myself. After dinner with my friend, I drove with my sister to grab a hefty baguette from Panera so I could carb load.</p>

                <p>I woke up at 3AM the morning of the race to shower, change, and fuel up. We arrived at the race site an hour before the race, so I was able to warm up and use the bathroom two times before the 6:15AM start time. I was surprised by how many porta-potties were available; normally there's never-ending lines of people waiting to use them. At 6:05AM, I lined up at the start line, positioning myself a couple feet away from Bin, the 3:10 pacer.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 500;">Mile 1-13</h3>
                <p>Since this race is relatively small, the start was relatively low energy. I had some difficulty starting my Strava when we started so I was fiddling with my watch for the first 0.1 miles. Even though it eventually worked, I was a bit annoyed that my watch would be inaccurate for the entirety of the race, and that the final recorded distance would likely be less than 26.2 miles.</p>

                <p>I tucked myself in a pretty sizable group of people who also wanted to run 3:10, and began clipping miles with ease. A part of me wondered if I should have perhaps went with the 3 hour group, but thankfully I did not let my emotions get the better of me. I told myself numerous times during training that I had to resist the temptation to deviate from the 3:10 plan. Early race miles are always free since you're running off of pure adrenaline. The fast miles will catch up to you eventually if you aren't careful.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 500;">Miles 14-20</h3>
                <p>This is probably what happened to many runners today, as the 3:10 pace group began to thin out at this point. I think there were around six of us still remaining in the 3:10 pace group. I committed to staying steady until mile 20, which was when I would assess whether or not I could make a push.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 500;">Miles 21-24</h3>
                <p>What was left of the 3:10 pace group completely fell apart here. Half of the group surged ahead, while the other half began to lag behind. I decided to bet on myself and surge ahead with this middle aged man wearing a purple sleeveless shirt. I later found out after the race he was able to get a Boston qualifying time of 3:08. I think he needed a 3:10 for his age, but I could be mistaken. I stuck right beside him for a little while, and he complimented me for keeping up. I also saw my middle school friend on the other side of the road, since the half started an hour and a half after the full and the courses overlapped with each other.</p>

                <p>I soon began to feel slight pulses in my calves, so I decided to let purple shirt guy go off ahead. A spectator must have seen me struggling since she saw my bib and cheered for me by name. I wish I could have said something back, but I was so terrified my calf would just lock up I didn't want to waste any breath. I made eye contact with a volunteer who was handing out water and I stretched out my arm. He pointed at me and yelled something along the lines of "I got you!!"</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 500;">Miles 25-26.2</h3>
                <p>Bin caught back up to me at this point, so I decided that I was going to try to latch onto him for the rest of the race. Bin must have had some unexpected pain or something though, as he began to slow down during mile 25. He urged me to keep going, which slightly scared me since that meant I would be running in no man's land. I ended up running with some half marathoners, but it wasn't quite the same.</p>

                <p>Bin ended up catching back up to (and passing) me as we got to mile 26, and unfortunately I was unable to stick with him. I felt like I had so much more to give, but I knew my calves would lock up if I pushed the pace by even just a hair. I ended up limping across the finish line in 3:10:52. I made sure to thank Bin afterwards- I don't think I could've done it without his steady pacing and encouragement.</p>

                <p>As a side note, I was wise to not push any harder. Once I met my mom and sister at the finishers' area, my left calf and right thigh cramped so bad I almost cried. Medical staff checked in with me to make sure I was okay. Sometimes I don't know why I willingly sign up for these races...</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 500;">Takeaways</h3>
                <p>Increasing mileage to 60-70 miles per week during this training block paid dividends. I had so much endurance, and as I said earlier, I felt like I had so much more to give. But even the strongest aerobic base can only get you so far if you lack the strength to maintain a fast speed. I think that's the biggest takeaway for my third marathon. I'm a pretty weak runner and I hope to change that in the next time.</p>

                <p>One thing I want to highlight is how seamless Carlsbad was. The event was so well-organized, clean, and contained. My favorite marathon as of yet, and I could definitely see myself coming back again for a future race.</p>

                <p>I think I've gotten to a point where many of my non-runner friends would consider me relatively fast. Of course I recognize there is still a lot of room for improvement, but most people remember 6-7 minutes being their fastest mile time, so I suppose it's saying something if I can average 7:17 min per mile, 26.2 times. It feels good to be a 3:10:XX marathoner, but I know that there's still so much I can do to get even faster. Needless to say, I'll be gunning for sub 3 next time.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 500;">Background</h3>
                
                <p>After previously running a 4:22 marathon, I told myself I would come back stronger to break the sub-4 barrier. I think I mentioned something last time about running Long Beach, but that plan never came through. In fact, I never attempted to run sub-4 again until I began to hear of the times that people I knew personally were running. An old friend recently ran his first marathon in under 4 hours, and my sister’s best friend ran her first in 4:14. This poked at my ego, so I decided to kill two birds with one stone: (1) finally run sub-4 and (2) beat some of these familiar times.</p>
            
                <p>Up until this point, I was running roughly 25-30 miles a week. Having just matriculated into graduate school, I think this was a good decision on my part. However, I knew that I needed to bump this weekly mileage to the 40-50 range if I wanted to see a considerable improvement in my time.</p>
            
                <p>The initial goal I set out at the beginning of this training block was actually 3:40, but I changed this to 3:30 after a successful 21 mile long run at an 8 minute pace.</p>
            
                <div style="clear: both;"></div>
                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 500;">Pre-race</h3>      

                <p>My sister and I arrived at the San Diego Convention Center around noon on Saturday, and it was packed. I knew Rock 'n' Roll events were crowded, but seeing it firsthand really drove the point home.</p>

                <img src="images/sandiego1.png" alt="San diego start line" style="float: right; width: 280px; margin: 0 0 1rem 1.5rem; border-radius: 6px;">
                <p style="float: right; clear: right; width: 280px; color: #666; font-size: 0.85rem; font-style: italic; text-align: center; margin: -0.5rem 0 1rem 1.5rem;">A very crowded start line.</p>

                <p>After picking up my race bib, we checked into the Hilton hotel that our mom booked for us with a hefty discount since she used to work for the company. It was probably the nicest place we've stayed at our entire lives. The hotel was enormous—so large that it was hosting a multi-day Indian wedding that weekend. My sister and I even got into the wrong elevator at one point, not realizing that different elevators were designated for different floors.</p>

                <p>We woke up early the next day and managed to navigate through the traffic. Unfortunately, the only free parking we could find was about a 40-minute walk from the start line. We figured parking closer to the finish line would be more convenient, but in retrospect, being on my feet for that long before the race probably wasn’t ideal.</p>

                <p>The start line was overwhelming. I couldn't even use the bathroom since the lines to the porta-potties were all so long. It also smelled pretty bad, which is a note to myself to reconsider signing up for such huge races. With only a couple minutes left before the start, I dumped all of my belongings to my sister and headed to the starting chute.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 500;">Miles 1-7</h3>
                <p>The first couple miles were pure chaos and congestion. I felt encaged early on, but I resisted the temptation to weave in and out, focusing on conserving energy. I was impeded from getting to the 3:30 pace group, so I just made sure they were never out of sight. I also recognized some running influencers that have appeared on my Instagram feed (Bearsun and one other whose name is escaping me at the moment). The sheer amount of people in the course made it difficult to get water from the water stations, so I just skipped water early on.</p>
                
                <p>At mile 7, there was a fork in the road that separated the half-marathoners from the full-marathoners. From that point on, the course began to clear up.</p>
                
                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 500;">Miles 8-17</h3>
                <p>With the half-marathoners gone, it was obvious who was in the 3:30 pack. The pack comprised of women who I assumed were trying to qualify for Boston, and then these massive shirtless men. I felt like the odd man out, but it was inspiring to be running with a diverse group of people who all shared the same goal. The pacer made sure to give us advice all throughout the course, telling us where to expect water, uphills, etc. 10/10 pacer would recommend. At mile 13, I texted my sister that I felt amazing. Famous last words...</p>
                
                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 500;">Miles 18-22</h3>
                <p>I think it was around mile 18 that I felt my right calf beginning to pulse, which gave me this huge feeling of dread. I tried to ignore it, but the thought of an impending cramp kept gnawing at me. I needed to fuel up, but I only had one more gel. I was also really thirsty, so I took advantage of every water station I saw from that point on. I also noticed that the pulsing in my right calf worsened whenever I landed on an uneven surface, so I made sure to keep my eyes on the ground to make sure I was only running on smooth surfaces.</p>
                
                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 500;">Miles 23-26.2</h3>
                <p>There was an incline at mile 23 that the pacer warned us about, so I wanted to stop by the water station right before it. In order to drink all the water from the cup (and to wait for the 3:30 group to catch up to me), I slowed down to walking pace at the mile 23 water station. . . which was a huge mistake. The adrenaline from running wore off, and the cramp hit me hard. I was able to still run, but I saw myself getting left behind by the 3:30 group.</p>
            
                <p>At this point it was all about damage control. I started doing mental calculations to see if I could at least attain my initial 3:40 goal. The pain was so unbearable I began walking... but this woman who was also left behind by the 3:30 group caught up to me and encouraged me to keep running. From then on, I alternated between running and walking. I alternated between walking 20 steps and running as long as I could before the cramps returned. It was so brutal, and all I could think about was how I needed to pay more respect to the marathon distance. I’m pretty bad at hiding my physical pain, so I know for a fact that all the spectators saw me writhing in agony.” I remember one spectator in the last half mile shouting, "Finish the race!!" Another saw my bib and yelled, "You can do this, Justin!" Their encouragement kept me going, and I crossed the finish line in 3:31:51.</p>
                
                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 500;">Takeaways</h3>
                <p>I’m realizing I only focused on the negatives, so I should make it a point that I was so happy and thankful to be a part of this marathon. It was so cool running alongside thousands of runners, and the whole experience reminded me why I even run in the first place. I improved so much from the 2023 Orange County Marathon too. A 50 minute PR is quite impressive if I do say so myself.</p>
                
                <p> That said, there’s still plenty of room for improvement: higher weekly mileage, more long runs, better nutrition, and optimized running gear. Last training cycle I averaged 27 miles per week; this time, 45. Next time, I’d like to hit the 60-mile range. 2030 Boston Marathon perhaps?</p>

                <p>Running a marathon has always been on my bucket list, and I figured now was the best time to sign up for one. I was able to complete the Rose Bowl Half in under two hours earlier in the year so I felt like I was in the best running shape of my life.</p>
            
                <div style="clear: both;"></div>
                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 500;">Pre-race</h3>      

                <p>Though I was antsy the entire week leading up to this race, I felt confident that I was ready. By Saturday, though—the day before the race—that confidence had shifted into an overwhelming sense of dread. The longest I’d ever run was 20 miles, and I had only done that twice. Even on those runs, I burned out near the end. Still, I wasn’t going to change my plan of aiming for a sub-4 finish.</p>
            
                <p>Sleep was nonexistent that night—zero hours. It was brutal. I reminded myself, though, that they say the sleep two nights before the race matters most, so I wasn’t too worried.</p>

                <p>At the start, I was initially placed in corral 1, but that group was filled with runners aiming for 3:55 and below. I decided to switch to corral 2, which started five minutes later. It felt a bit cheesy, but I almost got emotional standing at the start line. I think I just realized that I’d come a long way, and just being at the start line was an accomplishment in itself.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 500;">Miles 1-2</h3>
                <p>I found the 4:00 pacers and made sure to keep them within a comfortable distance. For those unfamiliar, a pacer is a volunteer who runs at a set speed, holding signs that indicate their target finish time. I positioned myself just behind the pacers holding the 4-hour sign. Soon, a small group formed behind them, and I felt a sense of camaraderie knowing these were the people I’d be running with for the long haul.</p>
                
                <p>A 19-year-old USC student named Daniel introduced himself, and we chatted for a bit. He was very talkative—which normally wouldn’t be an issue—but I wanted to conserve my energy. That said, he ended up playing a surprisingly significant role in my race.</p>
                
                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 500;">Miles 3-16</h3>
                <p>I found my running rhythm, and it felt amazing. I made sure to snack on Sour Patch Kids and raisins every now and then, and I grabbed some water at the stations. Everything seemed to be going well—I even texted my sister at the halfway mark, something along the lines of, “HALFWAY SO EASY.” How naive I was...</p>
                
                <p>Also, the view was beautiful. I couldn’t help but soak it all in.</p>
                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 500;">Miles 17-24</h3>
                <p>I felt the first signs of a cramp coming on, so I consumed all the snacks I had in the hopes that it would go away. It worked temporarily… but, of course, it eventually came back. I had to slow down considerably, and my heart sank as I watched the 4-hour pacers disappear out of sight. Instead of the 9-minute miles I’d been running so comfortably in the first half, my pace dropped to 12–13 minutes per mile. I alternated between walking, jogging, and sometimes stopping completely.</p>   
                
                <p>Around mile 18 or 19, I got a lifesaving boost from behind. Daniel, who had fallen off the 4-hour pace group around mile 15, caught up to me. I initially felt embarrassed to be seen struggling, but he handed me some energy gummies and encouraged me to keep going. Honestly, I don’t think I would’ve continued without him. From there, we took turns passing each other, cheering each other on… and eventually, my cramps subsided! I could finally hold a steady pace. Daniel must have felt better too, because we ended up running in lockstep, complaining about the pain we were experiencing.</p>
                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 500;">Miles 25-26.2</h3>

                <img src="images/orangecounty1.png" alt="Orange county finish line" style="float: right; width: 280px; margin: 0 0 1rem 1.5rem; border-radius: 6px;">
                <p style="float: right; clear: right; width: 280px; color: #666; font-size: 0.85rem; font-style: italic; text-align: center; margin: -0.5rem 0 1rem 1.5rem;">I finished! Though very much in pain.</p>
                <p>The last 1.2 miles felt like the longest of my life. The cramps that had subsided earlier came back—twice as bad. My entire right calf was on fire, and my left thigh ached too. When I saw the “0.5 miles left” sign, I thought, <i>there’s absolutely no way I can run half a mile more</i>. I had underestimated the distance to the finish line, and when I turned the last corner and realized it was still so far away, it really messed with my psyche.</p>
            
                <p>At that point, my right calf completely locked up, so I paused, hoping the pain would ease. After about 10 seconds, I realized it wasn’t going away. And so… that last stretch of the race—the part that’s supposed to feel epic? Hahaha… yeah. It was pure tragedy. It’s a blur now, but I know I was in tears. It felt like I was dragging a pile of heavy rocks—my uncooperative right leg—the entire way.</p>
                
                <p>I know spectators were cheering, and I even heard the announcer call my name to encourage me. Seeing the stopwatch hadn’t hit 4:30 yet gave me a small sense of relief, but at that point, I only cared about finishing. And thankfully… we did.</p>
                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: 500;">Takeaways</h3>
                <p>First and foremost, I’m just thankful I had the opportunity to run my first ever marathon. Being able to run, move, and just be active is such a privilege. I’m also incredibly grateful for all the volunteers—I made sure to thank everyone I grabbed water from, and even that one spectator who handed me orange slices. And of course, I’m very thankful for Daniel. He finished around five minutes after me, so he also was able to run a sub-4:30!</p>
                
                <p>This race was insane though. So many emotions. I honestly don’t even know how to express all my thoughts. There’s a lot I would’ve done differently, but I think that’s something every first-time marathoner says. Speaking of which… I am a marathoner!!! Oh my goodness. That actually feels unreal. I’m not sure there was a single thing that pushed me to do it, but I know my sister and my best friend played huge roles in my running journey.</p>

                <p>Looking forward, I need to make two major adjustments. First—why did I think raisins and Sour Patch Kids were enough? That literally makes no sense. I should’ve experimented with running gels or snacks that provide electrolytes and salts to help prevent cramping. Second, my weekly mileage needs to go way up. Averaging around 27 miles a week was definitely not enough—I needed to be in the 40s. I also wish I had done more longer runs; I think it would’ve made miles 20–26.2 much more manageable.</p>

                <p>I already have my eyes set on my next marathon: October 15 at Long Beach. I’m confident I can break 4 hours, but that’s getting ahead of myself. For now, I think I deserve a break. Season 1 of my fitness journey has officially come to a close.</p>
